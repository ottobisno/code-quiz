# JavaScript Coding Quiz

## Motivation

The motivation for this project was to design a basic JavaScript quiz as a way of applying the knowledge I have learned thus far regarding HTML, CSS, JS, and Web APIs. 

## Description

The quiz consists of 4 different questions, each worth 5 points. The user is given 60 seconds total to complete the quiz. For each question answered incorrectly, 20 seconds will be subtracted from the user's total time for that given attempt. Whether the user is able to finish the quiz before the time runs out or not, the user will be prompted to enter their initials and store their score in the local storage to be displayed at the end of the quiz. The user will also have the option to clear the scores that have been stored previously.

### Potential improvement

I would like to update the quiz to have the stored scores at the end of the quiz organized from highest to lowest (top to bottom). I had a difficult time figuring out how to represent this with my current coding knowledge and since this wasn't specified as one of the acceptance criteria for this challenge, I opted not to do so at this time.
